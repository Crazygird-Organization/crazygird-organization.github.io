            <h2>How to use these</h2>
            <p>Most of the following JS codes use <em>bookmarklets</em>, which use bookmarks to run the JS code.
            To use these, follow the instructions below. <br> <b> Step 1. Make a bookmark.</b> I hope I don't need to tell you how to do this. <br>
        <b>Step 2: Edit URL.</b> This is pretty simple. Right click on the bookmark and press "Edit...".  <br>
        <b>Step 3: Insert Javascript Code.</b> D elete everything in the URL segment, put in " javascript: ", (DON'T FORGET THE COLON) and after that, paste your code. <br>
        Now, when you click the button, it should run the JS code.</p>
