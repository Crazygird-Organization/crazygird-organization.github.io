Trains are one of the best modes of transportation. I mean, it's not even close. Cars emit too much CO2. Trolleys have a weird habit of being at an intersection with 5 people tied to one track and 1 person tied to another. But trains, trains are just nuts. I mean, some can go 1/4th the speed of sound! That is a ridiculous amount, an amount that only gets more ridiculous when you realise that these trains cover such long distances.
