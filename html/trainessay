Trains are one of the best modes of transportation. I mean, it's not even close. Cars emit too much CO2. Trolleys have a weird habit of being at an intersection with 5 people tied to one track and 1 person tied to another. But trains, trains are just nuts. I mean, some can go 1/4th the speed of sound! That is a ridiculous amount, an amount that only gets more ridiculous when you realise that these trains cover such long distances. But trains, they carry so much supplies! They can go faster than boats, they can carry more than airplanes and cars, and you can just keep adding more cars! People think that trains aren't that good anymore, and to that I say hey! YOU KNOW HOW YOUR ANCESTORES TRAVELED? ON TRAINS! IT'S 10000000X TIMES BETTER THEN ON FOOT, AND CARS EMIT TOO MUCH CO2, BOATS CAN ONLY DRIVE ON WATER, AND PLANES ALSO EMIT TOO MUCH CO2
